Some ideas for transfer learning, using RFs and MLPs:

Baselines:
- RF: 
-- Train Source Only, Predict Target
-- Train Target Only, Predict Target
-- Train Source + Target, Predict Target + potential balancing, weighting, noising
-> see transfer_learning_rf.py

- MLP:
-- Train Source Only, Predict Target
-- Train Target Only, Predict Target
-- Train Source, Finetune on Target
-> see transfer_learning_nn.py

Advanced:

- RF to NN:
-- Train RF on Source, cast to MLP and finetune on Target
-> see Welbl, "Casting Random Forests as Artificial Neural Networks"

- Transfer Learning for RF:
-- Use Transformations of RF trained on Source to refine on Target
-> See Segev et al., "Learn on Source, Refine on Target: ..."

-- Use Feature Importance from RF learned on Source as prior for feature splits when building Target
-> See Rodner et al., "learning with Few Examples by Transferring Feature Relevance"
