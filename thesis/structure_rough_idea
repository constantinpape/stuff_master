Introduction
- The Challenge of Connectomics
- Machines segmenting the brain

Foundations
- EM Microscopy / Techniques and Images
- Image processing / Superpixel + Features
- Machine Learning Stuff / RF / Multicut
- Measures
- Structured Learning (?)

2d Multicut Workflow
- The Pipeline
- 2d pecularities - My own contribution
-- Flat superpixel
-- Anisotropic Feature Calculation
-- Scaling of z-edge weights
-- New feats for z-edges
-- Changing the MC (???)
- Integration into existing / new workflow(s) (???)

Structured Learning Workflow (?)

Data
- Datasets and their pecularities
- Large Datasets

Feature Evaluation
- using RF
- using Fabis Stuff

Segmentation Results
- Small Datasets
- ISBI 
- Large Datasets

Conclusion and Discussion
- Limitations of the Multicut





Style Choices:
- Prefer "we" over passiv
- use present
