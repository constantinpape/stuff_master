In this chapter, we will cover the basic ideas and concepts relevant to this thesis.
We start with a discussion of electron microscopy techniques for capturing brain tissue.
Then we explain techniques from Image Processing and Machine Learning, that are applied to process this data.
Finally, we cover the measures for evaluating the results of this processing steps.
